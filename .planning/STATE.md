# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-19)

**Core value:** A single personal command center that always answers "what do I own, what's painted, and what's ready to play" — with reliable backup/restore so local data is always recoverable
**Current focus:** v0.2.15 Painting Mode — roadmap defined, ready to plan Phase 84

## Current Position

Phase: 85 — Core Execution UI
Plan: 85-01 complete, next 85-02 (wave 1)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-05-19 -- 85-01 complete (ScrollArea + StepMetadataRow + PaintReadinessBanner)

```
Progress: [██        ] 20% (1/5 phases)
Phase 84: [✓] Data Layer + Early Tests
Phase 85: [ ] Core Execution UI
Phase 86: [ ] Shell, Route & Keyboard Shortcuts
Phase 87: [ ] Session Integration + Entry Points
Phase 88: [ ] Polish + Test Coverage
```

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- v0.2.14: 11 plans across 5 phases (2 days)
- v0.2.13: 13 plans across 6 phases (2 days)
- v0.2.11: 9 plans across 5 phases (single day)
- v0.2.10: 17 plans across 7 phases (single day)
- v0.2.9: 8 plans across 4 phases (single day)
- v0.2.8: 12 plans across 5 phases (2 days)
- v0.2.6: 11 plans across 6 phases (single day)

## Accumulated Context

### Key Architecture Decisions for v0.2.15

- Full-page route at `/painting-mode/$assignmentId` — mirrors GameDayPage pattern
- New feature module: `src/features/painting-mode/` (6 new files)
- No new DB migrations or Rust commands — entire data layer already in place
- One new transactional function: `completeStepWithSession` in `src/db/queries/recipeAssignments.ts`
- New `useCompleteStep` mutation must invalidate: step progress + kanban enrichment + unit assignments + dashboard action + workflow position keys
- Section-aware step ordering: `COALESCE(section.order_index, 999999), step.order_index` — enforced client-side
- One new npm package: `react-hotkeys-hook` v5.3.2 (8 KB, React 19 compatible)
- Keyboard shortcuts must be guarded: disabled when `e.target instanceof HTMLInputElement` or textarea
- Full-page layout hides sidebar — `PaintingModeLayout` wrapper, not the shared AppLayout
- Atomic step + session write follows `saveRecipeGraph` BEGIN/COMMIT pattern (flat inline SQL, no nested transactions)

### Key Pitfalls to Avoid

- `useToggleStepProgress` only invalidates `STEP_PROGRESS_KEY` — new `useCompleteStep` needs the broader set
- Wrong step ordering in multi-section recipes — derive first incomplete step client-side, not from DB row order
- Keyboard shortcuts firing in form inputs — guard at event handler level
- Sidebar remaining interactive in painting mode — use dedicated layout route

### Pending Todos

None.

### Open Blockers

None.
